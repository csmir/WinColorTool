# ðŸŽ¨ Windows Color Tool

This windows tool is intended to make it easier for users to get detailed color information, generate gradients & pick colors from the mouse position on the screen. This tool supersedes [Gradigen](https://github.com/csmir/GradiGen and greatly expands its usability. WCT can run in the background, and will pop up a console window upon request.
